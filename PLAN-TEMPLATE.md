# Title for the plan

## Prompt

Before responding to questions or discussion points in this
document, explore the ryll codebase thoroughly. Read relevant
source files, understand existing patterns (SPICE protocol
handling, channel architecture, async task model, image
decompression, egui rendering), and ground your answers in
what the code actually does today. Do not speculate about
the codebase when you could read it instead. Where a question
touches on external concepts (SPICE protocol, QEMU, QXL,
TLS/RSA, LZ/GLZ compression), research as needed to give a
confident answer. Flag any uncertainty explicitly rather than
guessing.

Consult `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the system architecture
overview, channel types, and data flow. Consult `AGENTS.md`
for build commands, project conventions, code organisation,
and a table of protocol reference sources. Key references
include `shakenfist/kerbside` (Python SPICE proxy with
protocol docs and a reference client),
`/srv/src-reference/spice/spice-protocol/` (canonical SPICE
definitions), `/srv/src-reference/spice/spice-gtk/`
(reference C client), and `/srv/src-reference/qemu/qemu/`
(server-side SPICE in `ui/spice-*`).

When we get to detailed planning, I prefer a separate plan
file per detailed phase. These separate files should be named
for the master plan, in the same directory as the master
plan, and simply have `-phase-NN-descriptive` appended before
the `.md` file extension. Tracking of these sub-phases should
be done via a table like this in this master plan under the
Execution section:

```
| Phase | Plan | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1. Message parsing | PLAN-thing-phase-01-parsing.md | Not started |
| 2. Decompression | PLAN-thing-phase-02-decomp.md | Not started |
| ...   | ...  | ...    |
```

I prefer one commit per logical change, and at minimum one
commit per phase. Do not batch unrelated changes into a
single commit. Each commit should be self-contained: it
should build, pass tests, and have a clear commit message
explaining what changed and why.

### Success criteria

We will know when this plan has been successfully implemented
because the following statements will be true:

* The code passes `pre-commit run --all-files` (rustfmt,
  clippy with `-D warnings`, shellcheck).
* New code follows existing patterns: channel handler
  structure, message parsing via `byteorder`, async tasks
  via tokio, event communication via mpsc channels.
* There are unit tests for new logic, and the existing tests
  still pass (`make test`).
* Lines are wrapped at 120 characters, single quotes for
  Rust strings where applicable.
* `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` have been
  updated if the change adds or modifies channels, message
  types, or compression algorithms.
* Documentation in `docs/` has been updated to describe any
  new features or configuration options.
* If the changes affect SPICE protocol behaviour, the
  relevant documentation in `shakenfist/kerbside/docs/` has
  also been reviewed and updated if needed.

### Future work

We should list obvious extensions, known issues, unrelated
bugs we encountered, and anything else we should one day do
but have chosen to defer to here so that we don't forget
them.

...

### Bugs fixed during this work

This section should list any bugs we encounter during
development that we fixed.

### Back brief

Before executing any step of this plan, please back brief
the operator as to your understanding of the plan and how
the work you intend to do aligns with that plan.
